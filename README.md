# DataParser

## The application was developed using Django framework for Backend and React Framework for Frontend. The Database used is PostGreSQL. 

## Key Points
1) Clone the repository using the command below
   ```shell
   git clone ....
   ```
2) Ensure you have Docker running in your system and run the command below
```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start the PostgreSQL database, Django Backend, and React Frontend in separate containers.

3) Backend is running in port 8000 and Frontend in 3000. You may adjust the ports to fit your preferences.
